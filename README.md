# HEP Sources

Source codes for my physics publications. The code is old and not good language-wise speaking. I haven't tried to compile it, but it is important to save it to be able to understand how exactly the results were obtained.

*A method for model-independent measurement of the CKM angle β via time-dependent analysis of the B0→Dπ+π−, D→K0Sπ+π− decays.*

A new method for model-independent measurement of the CKM angle β is proposed, that employs time-dependent analysis of flavour-tagged B0→Dπ+π− decays with D meson decays into CP-specific and K0Sπ+π− final states. This method can be used to measure the angle β with future data from the Belle II and LHCb experiments with the precision level of one degree.
